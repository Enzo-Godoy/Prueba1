	<!--In a programming lenguage , these programming instructiones are called statements

	A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements

	Js Statements are composed of : 
	Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.

	The statement6 are executedf, one by one, iin the same order as they are written

	How everityme the semicolon at the end of each executable statement separate Js statements
	Multiple statements separated by semicolons, on one line are allowed


	JS ignores multiples spaces.
	Good practice is to put spaces around operators 
	(= + - * /)-->
     
    <!--
    For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longers than 80 characters. 

    If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator.

    Javascript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets {...} 

    The purpos of code blocks is to defin statemens to be execute together.

    Js Keywords
    Js statements often start with a keyword to identify the Js action to be performed.
