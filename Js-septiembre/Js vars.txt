JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values.


Js Indentifiers 
All Js variables must be identified with unique names. 

These unique names are called identifiers. 

Identifieres can be short name (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age,sum, totalVolume). 

The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are : 

*Names can contain letter, digits, underscores, and dollar signs. 
*Names must begin with '$' and '_' 
*Names are case sensitive. 
*Reserved wors cannot be used as names.


The Assignment Operator .
In js, the equal sign(=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.

The "equal to" operator is written like == .

Js can hanlde many types of data. 
Strings are written indise double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes. 


Declares Js vars.

{
	var keywords;
}

//After the declaration, the variables has no value(Technically it has the value of undefined).
 To assign a value to the variable, use the equal sign. 

 {
  Var carMi;
  carMi = "BMW";

  // Also  we can assign a value to the variable when we declare it. 

  var carMi= "Fiat"; 
 }

 If we wanna declare many variables in one statement. separate the variables  by comma. 
 Vlue undefined for vars that has to bo calculates, or something that will be provided later, like user input.
